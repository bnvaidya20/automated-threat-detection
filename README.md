# Automated Threat Detection for Smart Buildings and IoT Networks

## Overview

This repository contains two comprehensive guides for implementing automated threat detection systems in different environments:

1. [**Securing Smart Buildings: Automated Threat Detection & Mitigation**](docs/automated-threat-smart-building.md) 

   Focuses on large-scale commercial buildings with complex IoT ecosystems, featuring AI-driven behavioral analysis and integration with building management systems.

2. [**Lightweight Automated Threat Detection and Migitation for IoT Networks**](docs/lightweight-threat-iot.md)

   Provides cost-effective solutions for constrained environments using optimized open-source tools and minimal hardware requirements.

## Key Features

### Smart Building Guide
- Hierarchical AI architecture (edge + core)
- Cross-system correlation rules (elevator + badge + camera)
- Compliance integration for critical infrastructure
- Case study with 92% detection accuracy

### Lightweight IoT Guide
- Resource-optimized tools (Zeek Light, BusyBox)
- Step-by-step attack simulations (CoAP/MQTT exploits)
- iptables/Zeek scripting for mitigation
- Works on devices with as little as 128MB RAM

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Assessment**  
   - Smart Buildings: Conduct 30-day baseline period  
   - IoT Networks: Map all devices with `nmap -sP`

2. **Deployment**  
   - Smart Buildings: Configure BACnet/KNX firewalls  
   - IoT Networks: Set up VLAN isolation (`vconfig add eth0 100`)

3. **Optimization**  
   - Smart Buildings: Weekly model retraining  
   - IoT Networks: Monthly storage cleanup with `logrotate`

| **Hardware**                  | SOC dashboard upgrades   | Annual refresh plan      |

## Getting Started

### For Smart Buildings
1. Review the [High-Level System Architecture](docs/automated-threat-smart-building.md#high-level-system-architecture)
2. Implement the [Deployment Checklist](docs/automated-threat-smart-building.md#deployment-checklist)
3. Integrate with existing BMS using [BACnet firewall configuration](docs/automated-threat-smart-building.md#enterprise-integration-guide)

### For IoT Networks
1. Set up a [Lab Architecture](docs/lightweight-threat-iot.md#lab-architecture) with Raspberry Pi
2. Test [Defense Techniques](docs/lightweight-threat-iot.md#advanced-threat-simulation-guide) like `iptables` rate limiting
3. Monitor with [Zeek scripts](docs/lightweight-threat-iot.md#implementation-guide) for protocol anomalies

## Case Study Results

| Metric                | Smart Building           | IoT Network              |
