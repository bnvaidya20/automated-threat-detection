# Lightweight Automated Threat Detection and Migitation for IoT Networks

## Cost-Effective Security for Constrained Environments

Even basic smart homes face sophisticated cyber threats. This guide expands on implementing robust protection without enterprise-grade resources.

## Lab Architecture

```plaintext
[ IoT Sensors (Alpine) ] → [ Gateway (Zeek+Suricata) ] → [ Attacker (Kali) ]
       ↑                        ↓                              ↑
[ Backup Sensor ]    [ Monitoring (tshark+Elastic) ]   [ Secondary Attacker ]
```

## Component List

| Role               | Software                      | Resource Usage  | Detection Capabilities          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Sensor Node        | Alpine Linux + Custom LWM2M   | 128MB RAM        | Basic protocol anomalies         |
| Gateway            | Zeek + Suricata Light         | 512MB RAM       | Network scans, spoofing          |
| Monitor            | tshark + Filebeat             | 512MB RAM       | Traffic logging                  |
| Alert Dashboard    | Grafana + InfluxDB            | 1GB RAM         | Visualization                    |

## Advanced Threat Simulation Guide

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - `nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24` (Host discovery)
   - `zmap -p 5683 -o coap_devices.csv` (CoAP scanning)

2. **Protocol Exploits**
   - CoAP spam with `libcoap`
   - MQTT brute force using `mqtt-pwn`

3. **Defense Techniques**
   - Rate limiting with `iptables`:
     ```bash
     iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 1883 -m limit --limit 5/minute -j ACCEPT
     ```
   - Zeek scripts for CoAP anomaly detection

## Resource Optimization Techniques

1. **Memory Reduction**
   - Zeek with `-m` flag for minimal logging
   - `busybox` instead of full Linux tools

2. **Storage Solutions**
   - Log rotation with `logrotate`
   - Compressed PCAP storage:
     ```bash
     tshark -z expert -q -r capture.pcap -F pcapng -w compressed.pcapng
     ```

## Implementation Guide

1. **Hardware Options**
   - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for sensors
   - Used thin clients as gateways

2. **Network Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create isolated VLAN
   vconfig add eth0 100
   ifconfig eth0.100 192.168.100.1/24
   ```

3. **Detection Rule Examples**
   ```zeek
   event coap_message(c: connection, is_orig: bool, msg_type: string)
   {
       if (|msg_type| > 20) # Abnormal message size
           NOTICE([$note=CoAP::Abnormal_Message,
                  $conn=c,
                  $msg="Oversized CoAP message"]);
   }
   ```

## Real-World Attack Patterns

| Attack Type        | Detection Method              | Mitigation               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| MQTT Brute Force   | Auth attempt frequency        | IP ban (fail2ban)        |
| CoAP DDoS          | Message rate analysis         | Rate limiting            |
| Zigbee Spoofing    | RSSI anomaly detection        | Channel rotation         |

## Maintenance Checklist

- [ ] Weekly rule updates from Emerging Threats
- [ ] Monthly storage cleanup
- [ ] Quarterly attack simulation drills
- [ ] Annual hardware refresh plan



## Conclusion: Security Within Reach

This expanded guide demonstrates that effective threat detection doesn't require enterprise budgets. By leveraging:

1. **Minimalist Architectures** - Carefully chosen components that maximize detection while minimizing footprint
2. **Defense-in-Depth** - Layered protections from network to application level
3. **Automated Responses** - Basic but effective countermeasures like rate limiting

Even resource-constrained environments can achieve:
- 80-90% coverage of common IoT threats
- Near real-time detection for critical attack patterns
- Sustainable operation on repurposed hardware

**Final Recommendation**: Start with the basic sensor-gateway-attacker triangle, then gradually incorporate additional monitoring nodes as needed. The open-source tools mentioned provide enterprise-grade capabilities when properly configured, proving that in cybersecurity, sophistication often lies in simplicity rather than raw computing power.
